# A Big Bang Update!! A Lot Has Happened Since the Last Blog

After my last post about a bunch of colleagues being laid off, I did not expect to be writing this one so soon. But here I am, redundant. Eight years in the same company, and then suddenly, right in the middle of thinking about technical excellence, an email lands: *"Your role is at risk."* I panicked. Saying that out loud feels raw, but it is the truth.

Eight years is a long time in tech. I had become part of the furniture, a dinosaur even. One colleague joked that I was "RajGPT," a walking knowledge base of product and technical history. I took it as a compliment, though it felt strange to hear.

Not long before this, I had faced a health scare. A lump in my neck was suspected to be malignant. Those weeks were heavy and uncertain. Thankfully it was not cancer, but the experience reminded me how fragile life is. When redundancy came, it echoed the same feeling: the ground suddenly giving way.

Both moments taught me the same lesson. Nothing is permanent. Not health. Not stability. Not even the job you think you will always have.

Strangely, redundancy has been a blessing in disguise. It pushed me into side projects and straight into the world of AI. If AI played a part in making me redundant, I thought, then I might as well learn it and see what it can really do.

At first I was blown away. Using Claude Code felt like magic: fast, cheap, and clever. But the shine quickly faded. AI hallucinated, lost context, rewrote code I had already written, and even derailed product ideas I cared about. I ended up writing instructions like a teacher to a junior developer: context, tests, git etiquette, performance notes, security checks. Over and over. And yes, I lost my patience. If it had been a person, HR would have had words with me.

Still, the frustration taught me something important. AI is not superhuman. It is a tool, a reflection of us. It works best when we bring clarity, critical thinking, and patience. And sometimes the best fix is not pushing harder, but stepping away, taking a break, and coming back fresh. That is not AI magic. That is human mechanics.

So here I am, jobless but building, frustrated yet hopeful. I am learning to see myself not just as an engineer, but as the architect, the orchestrator, the human at the centre of it all.

And maybe that is enough for now.
