# 1... 2... 3... and we are live

_April 2025_

So, a while ago, I started carving out my own little space in the digital universe.

I tried creating it with ReactJS — because it felt like the “right” way to do it. But somewhere along the way, I got stuck. Juggling learning React with staying productive was a weird tug-of-war between curiosity and pressure. Slowly, the project faded into the background.

Fast forward a few years.

It’s 02:39 in the morning. I’m here, typing. Still building. Still stumbling. But this time, something’s different.

This time, I’ve got ChatGPT — a tool that’s become the mentor I always wished I had. One that doesn’t mind late-night ramblings or beginner questions. It’s helped me move past the noise and simply… begin again.

I’m getting things done in React now, piece by piece. But I can’t shake the feeling that I’m winging it most of the time. And maybe that’s okay — maybe winging it is just what learning looks like up close.

This little blog is a place to think out loud. A place to come back to when I need to reconnect with why I build in the first place.

Let’s see where it goes.
