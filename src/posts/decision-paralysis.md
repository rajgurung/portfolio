# Overcoming Decision Paralysis

_April 2025_

For a while, I felt stuck.

Every time I sat down to start a side project, I hit a wall of choices:  
What should I build?  
Should I use Ruby on Rails? Or Go? Or maybe Node.js?  
Frontend with React? Or just stick to Hotwire?

Too many options. Not enough momentum.

I’d jump between ideas — a local app for Nepal, a Rails gem, a chat app, a dashboard — but never commit. I was waiting for the “perfect” thing to build. It never came.

What helped was lowering the bar. I asked myself: *What’s small, useful, and close to what I already know?*

That led me to **MVP Pulse** — a simple heartbeat monitoring gem for MVPs. Just send a ping from your app and get notified if it stops.

I'm building it in Ruby. I’ll probably use Rails for the dashboard, maybe add a Node.js Kafka producer later. But now the stack isn’t the focus — the *finish line* is.

If you’re feeling paralysed by choice, start smaller. Pick one tool. One idea. One step.

Clarity often comes *after* action — not before it.
