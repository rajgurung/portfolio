# You’ve Been Impacted, Layoffs

For the past four to five years, I’ve watched it unfold from the sidelines. Layoffs, year after year. Colleagues I’ve worked with for a long time, gone. People I shared coffee with before COVID, and many more I connected with virtually since. Relationships built slowly over time, some I’ll cherish forever.

Though I work fully remote, the room feels quieter with every goodbye. Their absence echoes louder than silence. No more quick messages, no more calls to vent, laugh, or simply be human together.

Every time that dreaded email rolled out—the one that begins with “You’ve been impacted”—I felt the fear tighten in my chest. What if it’s me this time? Can I afford it? With a young family, a little boy nearly two, and my dear wife who paused her career to raise him, could we weather it?

Each time, I’d steel myself. Muster a quiet moment of “whatever comes, comes,” then open my inbox. I felt quiet relief—followed by guilt for being spared.

I’ve always believed that the salt you take must be repaid with sincerity and effort. So I’ve worked hard. Burned countless midnight hours, hoping to make a difference, even a small one. But the truth is, effort alone doesn’t always shield you. In a time of layoffs, AI upheaval, and constant change, who knows what the future holds?

If there’s one thing I’ll carry with me when my time comes, it’s the quiet strength I’ve seen in those who went before me. Colleagues who showed grace, resolve, and dignity in the face of uncertainty. One conversation in particular still echoes: “It was fun while it lasted. It hurts, but I’ll soldier on.”

That’s what a fighter does. You acknowledge the fear. You don’t despair. You don’t fold. You carry on, one day at a time.

To my colleagues who have been affected by layoffs: I wish you all the best. I know words aren’t enough, but please accept my deepest, humble apology. It’s the least I can offer.

In these unforgiving times, I want us all to try to be kind. Though we may have built the mental muscle to endure these layoffs, we still have a duty to act with humanity. Be humble. Be helpful. Be empathetic. A kinder world heals the soul and in time, it may heal the fractures we don’t always speak of.
